# Jack Burkholder's Git Repository for Front-End Web Development 

## Django Projects

For the second semester we are using
[Django](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)) for Full-Stack Development. I have another
repo [here](https://git.gctaa.net/jackburkh/django_projects) for that work.

<h2>
  What is Copyright?
</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Copyright is a legal right that grants creators exclusive control over the use and distribution of their original works.</p>
  <p>Copyright doesn't cover facts, ideas, systems, or methods.It covers the specific way they're expressed. </p>
  <p>Copyright doesn't protect the idea itself, it protects the final written or artistic work.</p>
  <p>In 1983, traditional copyright law was expanded to include machine-readable software, granting them the same copyright status as literary works. </p>

<h2>
  Ownership Of Code
</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Code is treated as if it is a literary work. Who ever is behind the keyboard owns the code. Unless it is for a company or a contract states another owner.</p>
  <p>Think of it like an author. They own their book, unless they sell it off to a company, or they wrote it for a company while employed under them.</p>
<p>An interesting topic right now is who owns AI written code</p>
<p>Currently it is treated as if the user who prompted the code to be written by the AI wrote it themselves.</p>
<p>However if the prompts include copywritted material, the person who owns the copywrite may have a claim to the code.</p>

<h2>
  Enforcing a Copyright
</h2>
  <hr>
<p>
  Enforcing copyrighted web development involves protecting work such as websites, code, and other digital content. Copyright enforcement can include:
  <ul>
   <li>Sending cease and desist notices</li>
  <li>Getting takedowns done against stolen copyright content</li>
  <li>Pursuing legal action against infringers.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
  
<hr>
<p>
    Copyright protection is automatically applied when you make a piece of web design, though copyright registration can help enforce your own rights.

<h2>
  International Copyrights
</h2>
<hr>
<p> 
Since copyright laws are different per country, it is important to follow the correct legal actions to protect your web development.</p>

  <p>
    Many countries already have automatic copyright protection for web developments, but some do not and must have different actions taken.
  </p>
  <p>
    International Copyright Laws are actually made via treaties between countries, and unfortunately, the U.S. does not have treaties with every country.

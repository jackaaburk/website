    <pre>This             text

        spans              several
   lines

                     and             has             lots
  of         extra              

whitespace             because      it      uses      
the         <b>pre</b>            element.</pre>
<li>
    Sounds like a opportunity
    I call her chandelier
    Tell 'em to bring out the cappucino
    Let's go golfing
    Tell 'em to bring the yacht out
</li>
